# Detailed Steps to Implement WFC in Unity 6 ECS

## Phase 1: Environment Setup & Planning (1-2 weeks)
1. Create a Unity 6 project
2. Set up version control (Git)
3. Create folder structure aligning with ECS architecture
4. Create documentation for design patterns and data flow
5. Map out the core components, systems, and jobs

## Phase 2: Core Data Structure Conversion (2-3 weeks)
1. Convert Grid to blob asset format
2. Create component definitions for all node types
3. Implement native container replacements for core collections
4. Design Burst-compatible math operations
5. Create serialization systems for loading rule configs

## Phase 3: Algorithm Implementation (3-4 weeks)
1. Implement WFC propagation as parallel jobs
2. Create systems for each major node type (Rule, Path, Convolution)
3. Implement search algorithms using ECS pattern
4. Create state management for generation process
5. Add debugging capabilities

## Phase 4: Rendering & Visualization (2-3 weeks)
1. Create entity prefabs for visualization
2. Implement mesh/texture generation systems
3. Build real-time visualization of generation process
4. Add debug visualization for algorithm internals
5. Optimize rendering for large-scale output

## Phase 5: Unity Integration & Tooling (2-3 weeks)
1. Create custom inspectors for configuration
2. Build asset importers for tilesets/samples
3. Implement scriptable object configurators
4. Add runtime parameter adjustment
5. Create example scenes demonstrating different algorithms

## Phase 6: Testing & Optimization (2 weeks)
1. Profile performance bottlenecks
2. Optimize job scheduling
3. Add memory usage monitoring
4. Create benchmarking tools
5. Implement automated tests

## Phase 7: Documentation & Cleanup (1-2 weeks)
1. Document public API
2. Create usage examples
3. Clean up code and add comments
4. Create tutorials for extending the system
5. Package for distribution

## Start with a Minimal Prototype
1. Begin with just one algorithm (TileNode or OverlapNode)
2. Implement only the core ECS components needed
3. Create a working end-to-end prototype before expanding

## Team Allocation
- 1-2 developers for core algorithm conversion
- 1 developer for Unity-specific integration
- 1 developer for visualization and rendering

Total estimated time: 3-4 months with a team of 2-3 developers
